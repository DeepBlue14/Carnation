### **Progress Report**
I discovered a 3D graphics library (JavaScript) called Three.js.  I've used it
to create some 3D functionality for my project: the logo in the start page is
on a 3D cube which spins.  I know it sounds fairly simple, but coding it up
was somewhat difficult (see src/cube_animation.coffee).

I've also fleshed out the HTML front end: now there are three pages:
**Start page**
Select start location, goal location, and various options.

**Loading page**
This page runs while the path-planning is going on.  I also created a colored
spinning loading animation in CSS for this page as well.

**Result page**
Will display the instructions and map rendering (this is still in progress).

All three of these pages are using Bootstrap, and I've been testing with
various screen sizes, including both desktop and mobile.
