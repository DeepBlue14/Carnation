### **Progress Report**
Over the last few days, I have been working with JavaScript's asynchronous
functions, which I have found to be very common (and rather challenging).
One of the specific examples I encountered is the I/O functions for
reading/writing images, using the pngjs library.  I am more familiar with the
C++/Java model of functions typically being synchronous, with threading being
a explicit addition on the part of the user.  Therefore, I kept running into
issues where functions such as the load(image-path) would return before the
image had actually finished being read.

After digging through some documentation, I discovered how to set up
trigger/callback pairs, so that my code which manipulates the images will
now be called in this manner.  After implementing these changes, my
synchronization issues are all resolved.


I have also discovered and considered "web workers", which are apparently the
JavaScript multi-threading library.  Perhaps I could talk briefly about them
at the next class.
