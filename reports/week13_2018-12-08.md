### **Progress Report**
Here are some of the highlights of this week:

**User Accounts**
I can now successfully create/load/save user accounts.  This is my first time using web-based databases, so it took me far longer then it probably should have.

**Dynamic DB Floorplan Content**
Up until now, the paths to various floorplan PNGs were hard-coded into my HTML files.  Now they can be (more or less) dynamically loaded from a JSON file, which specified which images go to which buildings.  It's still a little buggy though -- I plan to get it totally working on 12/09.

**More 3D Content**
I tried (and failed, at least at the moment) to add a 3D background with falling snow.  For some reason, it fails to load, resulting in a plain black canvas background.  I've removed it, but may make another attempt to get it working between now and my presentation on Tuesday.  I think the problem is that since I already have a 3D canvas (the rotating cube in my header), the second renderer is messing up the first.

**Misc.**
I've been polishing my project.  Trying to find and fix any edge cases, make sure it's running smoothly on Weblab, etc.  Making small changes to clean up and document my code.  I fixed some CSS animations.
