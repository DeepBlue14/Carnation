### **Progress Report**
Here are some of the highlights of this week:

**Terms, Privacy, Security, etc.**
One thing which I was struggling with at the beginning of this week was how
to make my project look polished and professional.  While I was happy with
the general look and feel, there seemed to be something missing.

Then I realized that the (or at least one) distinction between my project and
and actual website is the lack of links to view terms and conditions.  These
have since been added, using pop-up windows and Bootstrap styles (see
terms.html, privacy.html, security.html, and contact.html).

**User Accounts & Encryption**
One of my goals for this project was to incorporate at least a bit of every
main topic which was covered in class.  Two of the main features which were
missing from my project were a method for users to create and save accounts,
and any form of encryption (for storing usernames and passwords).

I'm using a "nosql" database called CouchDB (by Apache), and sha.js for the
encryption. I have this area only partially working at the moment (it's my
first time using these technologies from the development-side).  Hopefully
I'm able to finish it by the end of this weekend (see sign_in.html and
sign_up.html).

**Client vs Server Side**
There's one part of my project which I'm not sure whether to put server-side
(where it currently is) or client-side.  I found a JavaScript library called
Browserify (http://browserify.org/) which bundles dependencies so that
server-side libraries can be easily accessed from the client.  I installed
this and ran in on pngjs, so that I can compare client vs server runtime.

**Misc.**
I've discovered the hard way that custom Bootstrap themes can lead to problems
with additional/overwritten classes.  There's no easy solution -- just the
power of Google to search for answers.
