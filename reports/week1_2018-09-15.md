### **Progress Report**
Brainstorming project ideas.  I keep getting lost in the new CS building
(Dandeneau Hall).  It would be interesting if I could develop some sort of
indoors Google Maps for the campus.

I am in the process of doing a feasability study, and going through Google
Scholar to see if anyone has done anything similar.  I may have to restrict
it to single floors, since getting from one floor (or even building) may
be a significant challenge.
