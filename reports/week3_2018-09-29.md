### **Progress Report**
I began implementation.  Here are a few highlights:

**Image Matrix Manipulation**
I found the Node.js library **pngjs**, an API for manipulating images on a
pixel level.  I wrote some sample programs to get a feel for this library.

**Node.js vs Ruby on Rails**
I have resolved my "Node.js vs Ruby on Rails" question.  After an extensive
literature review, I chose Node.js for a number of reasons.  Primarily, RoR
appears to be on the decline, making Node.js a more markitable skill.

**CoffeeScript**
My original plan was to go with JavaScript; however, I decided to use
CoffeeScript instead.  CoffeeScript is a high-level programming language which
trans-compiles directly to JavaScript.  Thus, it allows full JavaScript
compatability (including the use of JavaScript libraries), without JavaScript's
sub-optimal syntax and other various issues.  (Note: This is not an attempt to
discredit JavaScript -- it's impressively good for a language which was
dreamed up in 11 days).

**Navigation API**
I implemented a number of useful data structures for navigation.  Which are
nessissary since I have to figure out how to get a person from a start state
to a goal location.  This sub-API is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS
http://www.ros.org/) project, though ROS is C++/Python, and mine is a pure 
JavaScript implementation.
