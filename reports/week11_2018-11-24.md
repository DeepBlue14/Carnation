### **Progress Report**
Here are some of the highlights of this week:

**Tooltips**
I used Popper.js and Bootstrap to create tooltips when hovering over various
options (see the checkboxes in index.html)

**User Input Validation**
I am using a jquery plugin called jquery-validation to utilize dynamic
validation of user inputs.  For example, if the user enters letters in the
"Room #" input boxes (see index.html, src/index_validation.coffee), they will
be prompted to enter digits.

**Local Dependencies**
I've removed my javascript dependency hot linking for local dependencies.  If
I understand the pros and cons correctly, this will result in faster load
times, but a larger overall distribution package.  These changes can be seen in
the headers of any of my html files.

**The Gallery**
Since this project involves traversal around campus, it made sense to have a
photo gallery featuring an image of each building.  Thus, of the user does
not remember the name of building they want to start or go to, they can take
a look at this page (see html/gallery.html).

**Misc.**
I've also made various miscellaneous improvements, including:
- Created a primative "about" page
- Changed css (bootstrap) theme
- Bug fixes (src/sensor_msgs/Image.coffee
- Resolved resource paths
- Added tests (test/...)
- Formatting
- Started an "about" page (html/about.html) based on the README file.
- added "help" page (html/help.html)
