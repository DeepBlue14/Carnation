### **Progress Report**

**Path Planning: From Point "A" To Point "B"**
One challenge I encountered this week was in my path-planning code.  The
original algorithm I planned to use guarentees an optimal solution -- however,
I discovered through testing that it is slower then I would like.

I did a literature search to find some optimizations, and after implementing
these, the algorithm can now final a good (though no longer optimal) solution
in a reasonable amount of time.


**Project Structuring**
I was originally unsure as to how to structure the overall project (e.g.
where to put source files, libraries, etc.).  Based on several tutorials
and other online references, I have settled on a structure which I am
satisfied with:
- html
- css
- node_modules
- res
 - image
 - floor_plans
 - src
 - test
 - weekly_reports
 - doc


**Web Page or Mobile, That is the Question**
Based on Dr. Haim's recommendation in last week's lecture, I am in the process
of adapting my css files to reflect a mobile interface, instead of the
original web-page based front-end.

Dr. Haim pointed out that it is easier to make an interface first for mobile
devices which can be later expanded to include web pages, rather then
developing it first for web pages and then attempting to shrink/cut it down
to fit on a mobile screen.
