### **Progress Report**

**Search Algorithms**
I performed a literature review to find a good search algorithm, since this
is one of the more important features of the project.  I am selected the
A-Star (A*) algorithm.  It is both accurate and fast, which make it ideal for
my application.

I considered A* derivatives, such as Jump-Point search, but these don't appear
to have significant performance increase relative to their implementation
complexity.

**Elevator vs Stairs**
While working on the heuristic for my search algorithm, I realized that
determining the traversal cost of using an elevator vs using stairs may be a
bit complex, since it will vary person to person.  After all, an energetic
young student might think nothing of dashing up a few flights of stairs, while
a professor may be more inclined to take the elevator.

For simplicities sake, at the moment I have set the traversal cost to be
equal for both of these two options.


**Weblab**
My weblab account has been successfully activated!  I have a place-holder web
page at ```http://www.cs.uml.edu/~jkuczyns/```, and it works!  Next, I need to
move my actual project there.
